            <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 &frac34; vital wheat gluten</li>
                <li>1 350g package of firm tofu, drained & rinsed</li>
                <li>&frac23; cup no-chicken-style vegetable broth or bouillon, double-strength</li>
                <li>1 20-ounce can young green jackfruit in water or brine, drained and rinsed and shredded</li>
                <li>2 tsp tahini</li>
                <li>2 tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
                <li>&frac14; cup nutritional yeast</li>
                <li>&frac12; tsp liquid smoke</li>
                <li>2 tbsp white miso paste</li>
                <li>2 tsp poultry seasoning</li>
                <li>6-8 cups water, for cooking</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Method</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To a high-speed blender add tofu, no-chicken broth, tahini, sea salt, onion powder, nutritional yeast, poultry seasoning, liquid smoke, and white miso paste. Blend on high until smooth.
                </li>
                <li>Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer and add vital wheat gluten and shredded jackfruit. Using a flat paddle, knead on low speed until it comes together and starts to look like dough, about 3-5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Stop and swap out the paddle for a dough hook and knead at a low speed for 15- 20 minutes. The dough will be soft and slightly sticky with a fibrous texture. This is great for shredded chicken. If you want a more tender chicken, simply knead for only 5ish minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Divide in half and shape the halves into an oval “log” and place it in the center of a large square of foil. Roll it tight, twisting up the ends like wrapped candy. Wrap in a second layer of foil and make sure everything is TIGHT. Repeat with the second “log”.
                </li>
                <li>Fill a pressure cooker with 6-8 cups of water, and add both wrapped “logs”.
                </li>
                <li>Cook for 45 minutes under pressure. If you have a smaller pressure cooker, you may have to do this in batches.
                </li>
                <li>Release the pressure and remove the seitan rolls from the cooker and let them cool completely.
                </li>
                <li>(Alternatively, you can steam them for 1 hour, if you do not have access to a pressure cooker.)
                </li>
                <li>Remove the logs from the foil and transfer to a Tupperware container, and allow to sit to allow the fibers to develop further.
                </li>
                <li>Pull the seitan chicken into the chicken breast or bite-size pieces, or shred and use marinades, seasonings, or batter to customize the chicken to any dish.
                </li>
            </ol>
